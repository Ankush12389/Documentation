# Discovering all your APIs

Get ready for API security Observability! üöÄ

Whether you want to discover internal APIs, external APIs or third party APIs, you can use Akto to discover all your APIs in 10 mins. To do so, you first [deploy Akto and send traffic](broken-reference) to Akto to start seeing your API inventory. Here are the steps to follow:

‚òùüèº [Deploy Akto module](../../getting-started/quick-start-with-akto-self-hosted/aws-deploy.md)&#x20;

‚úåüèª Send traffic to capture the following:

&#x20; [   1. Public and internal APIs](broken-reference)

[     2. Third party APIs](broken-reference)

{% hint style="info" %}
It's a self hosted deployment, so traffic doesn't leave your VPC!)&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once you are done deploying and sending traffic, Akto will auto generate collections based on services/ load balancers that are sending traffic to Akto. Each of these collections has endpoints which receive traffic. ‚úÖ

### [API metadata:](understanding-api-metadata.md)

* **Request and Response:** Click on any endpoint to see the request and response parameters. All the endpoints marked <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> are sensitive endpoints passing sensitive data in parameters while all <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> endpoints are good endpoints with no sensitive params.

* **Method :** This is the API method used - `GET, POST, PUT, DELETE`.

* **Sensitive params:** You can see all the sensitive params that are present in the the endpoint once you click the endpoint.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Frame 28.png>)

* **Access Type:** You can check if the endpoint is public or private. See below. This information helps you discover private endpoints which are accidentally [publicly accessible](securing-private-apis-open-to-public.md). :hushed:

* **Auth type** üîë **:** You can check what auth token type is detected in the endpoint.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Frame 29.png>)

* **Sample Values:** You can check sample values of each API. Only last ten sample values are shown here for each endpoint. You can click on next to see other values.&#x20;

* **Traffic trend:** You can also see traffic trend of each API endpoint. :chart\_with\_downwards\_trend:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Frame 31.png>)

* **Discovered:** You can see when was the endpoint first discovered&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Frame 30.png>)

* **Last seen:** You can see when was the API endpoint hit last.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Frame 32.png>)

* **Changes:** You can see how many new params got added.
