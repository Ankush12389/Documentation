# What is Akto?

Applications are only as fast and secure as the APIs that power them. Today, fast pace of application development makes it very hard for security teams to ensure security coverage of APIs.&#x20;

**Akto enables security and engineering teams to secure all of their APIs from sensitive data leak by continuously learning business logic of all APIs at run time.**&#x20;

### How Akto works?&#x20;

We help teams with complete API security by continuously learning business logic of all APIs. Our approach has 4 pillars to API security:

* ****[**Observe**](broken-reference) **:** Build your API inventory with sensitive parameters and observe API changes in real time ensuring 100% visibility of all APIs
* **Find :** Conduct security testing of your APIs based on application logic, automated in CI/CD
* **Fix :** Fix your APIs with one click vulnerability fixes in CI/CD
* **Protect** : Protect your APIs by detecting and blocking malicious users exploiting application logic vulnerabilities, using AI based behaviour analysis

****[**OBSERVE**](broken-reference) **is the building block of Akto.**

We learn the business logic of APIs in this part to create API Inventory, build tests, suggest fixes and detect threats.
